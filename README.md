SpinalTapCodeMosh
=================

Yet another code-pastebin app powered by Dancer using the power of Backbone
for the UI.

Still has some bugs and missing features I want to add, but it's currently a
working RC that I'll use and see what really needs fixing / adding.

This has no affiliation with the band or any orthopedic procedures. Is so named
due to the components that power it.

Prereqs
-------

Requires [Perl Dancer](http://perldancer.org), and its 
[Database Plugin](https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::Database), to run.  
The app has several JS libs bundled in.  Please pay attention to the licensing on those 
libs before you go hacking on that code :)


JS Libs (Bundled within)
----

Credit where credit is due. Most of the magic and voodoo is done by other
people's work. I just moshed it all together with voodoo of my own.

* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)
* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery's Validation Plugin](http://jqueryvalidation.org/)
* [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)
* [Mustache Templates](http://mustache.github.io/)
* [Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter.](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/)

Persistance
-----------

Comes bundled with a SQLite DB for the moshes. But can be tweaked to use a
MySQL/Postgres/Oracle DB backend, should you wish. See the
[Dancer::Plugin::Database](https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::Database)
docs for how to do that.
